In order to have the Amazon CodePipe line working, ensure that the Elastic Beanstalk application/Environment is up and running.

The following yml file is required. the name should be buildspec.yml and take help of the CodeBuild specs here

(link)[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec-ref-example]

The artifacts:file name can be generated by running maven package command on localhost and copying the name from the last few lines og the log.


```yml
version: 0.2

phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      java: openjdk8
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - echo Entered the pre_build phase...
  build:
    commands:
      - echo Entered the build phase...
      - echo Build started on `date`
      - mvn package
      - echo Build started on `date`
  post_build:
    commands:
      - echo Entered the post_build phase...
      - echo Build completed on `date`
artifacts:
  files:
    - target/todo-app-rest-services-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Goto Amazon code pipeline, create a new pipe line with default settings adn provide the Github repository name.

It will automatically read the yml file and package the application and deploy it in the Elastic beanstalk server.
